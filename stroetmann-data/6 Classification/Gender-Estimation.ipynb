    "This notebook gives a simple example for a naive Bayes classifier.  We try to predict the gender of a first name.  In order to train our classifier, we need a *training set* of names that are marked as being either male.  We happen to have two text files, `names-female.txt` and `names-male.txt` containing female and male first names.  We start by defining the function `read_names`.  This function reads a file of strings and returns a list of all the names given in the file.  Care is taken that the newline character at the end of each line is discarded. "
