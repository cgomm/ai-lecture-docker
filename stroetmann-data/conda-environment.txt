The following commands create the virtual environment "ai" that is used in
the notebooks.

conda create -y -n ai python=3.7 jupyter notebook
source activate ai
conda install -y "nbconvert=5.6.1"
conda install -y -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
conda install -y -c anaconda graphviz
conda install -y -c conda-forge python-graphviz
conda install -y -c anaconda ply
conda install -y -c conda-forge ipycanvas
pip install jedi==0.17.2
pip install python-chess

If starting the jupyter notebook generates lots of warning of the form

  nbextension abc has duplicate listings in both uvw and xyz

then the underlying problem can be solved via the following command:

jupyter contrib nbextension uninstall --user
